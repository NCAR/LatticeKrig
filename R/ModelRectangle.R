    # LatticeKrig  rectangular spatial autoregression (SAR)) is based on
    # a set of location centers
    # (also known as RBF nodes) to center the basis functions. This function
    # takes advantage of the centers being on a regular grid and equally spaced.
    # Thus the SAR weights applied to nearest neighbors can be generated from the
    # row and column indices of the lattice points.
    #
    # How exactly is the lattice laid out?  Indexing the lattice by a 2-d, regularly spaced array
    # it is assumed the indices are also the positions.
    # row index is the 'x' and column index is the 'y'
    # So  (1,1) is in the bottom left corner and (mx1,nx) the top right.
    # This is of course  different than the usual way matrices are listed.
    # All directions for nearest neighbors use this 'location'
    # interpretation of the matrix indices i.e.  thinking of the indices
    # as the x and y coordinates  (1,2) is on _top_ of (1,1) -- not to the left.
    #
    # When the lattice is stacked as a vector of length m it is
    # done column by column -- the default stacking by applying the
    # 'c' operator to a matrix. The indexing for the stacked vector can be
    # generated
    # in a simple way by  c( matrix( 1:(mx1*mx2), mx1,mx2)) and this
    # is used in the code below.
    #  To list the indices with the right spatial orientation to label
    # as top, bottom, left and right,
    # use:  t(matrix( 1:(mx1*mx2), mx1,mx2))[mx2:1, ]

    #    CONVENTIONS FOR FILLING IN PRECISION MATRIX
    ###############################################
    #  Note: Dimensions of a.wght determine
    #  how the precision matrix will be filled
    #  For each node in the MRF there are
    #  4 nearest neighbors and 4 additional second order
    # neighbors
    # labels for these connections are
    #   'NE'    'top'    'NW'
    #    'L'  'center'    'R'
    #   'SE'    'bot'    'SW'
    #
    #  indices for these elements are given by
    #  matrix(1:9, 3,3)
    #   1 4 7
    #   2 5 8
    #   3 6 9
    #  however, the way the function is coded
    #  the ordering is scrambled to be
    #  index<- c( 5,4,6,2,8,3,9,1,7)
    #  This seemingly disorganized order is from dealing with the
    #  center lattice point, then the
    #  the nearest neighbors and then adding the second order set.
    #
    #  when stationary is TRUE here is how the precision matrix is filled:
    #
    #  length(a.wght)==1  just the center value is used with -1 as default for
    #  first order neighbors and 0 for second order
    #
    #  length(a.wght)==9  center value and all 8 neighbors as in diagram above
    #  order of the elements in this case is the same as stacking the 3 columns
    #  of 3X3 matrix. These are reordered below according to
    #  index<- c( 5,4,6,2,8,3,9,1,7)
    #
    #  when stationary is FALSE here is how precision matrix is filled:
    #
    #  if  a.wght depends on lattice position
    #  then dim(a.wght) should not be NULL and should have
    #  three dimensions with sizes mx1,mx2 and the third can have length
    #  1  or 9 depending on whether the neighbor connections are
    #  specified.
