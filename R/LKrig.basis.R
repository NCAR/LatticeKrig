    # is  t(X1-X2) solve(A) (X1-X2)  with A = (V %*%t(V))
    # Here's the deal on the linear transformation V:
    # It should be equivalent to just transforming the locations outside of LatticeKrig.
    # Where ever the observation locations are used
    # they are first transformed with t(solve(V))).
    # Surprisingly this only needs to happen in one place below and in LKrig.setup to
    # determine the grid centers.
    #
    # The RBF centers and the delta scale factor, however, assumed to be
    # in the transformed scale and so a  transformation is not needed.
    # see LKrig.setup for how the centers are determined.
    # The concept is that if LKrig was called with the transformed locations
    # ( x%*%t( solve(V)) instead of x
    # and V set to diag( c(1,1) ) one would get the same results.
    # as passing a non identity V.
