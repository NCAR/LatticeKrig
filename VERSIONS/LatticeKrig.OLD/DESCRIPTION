Description: Functions for the interpolation of large spatial
  datasets. This package follows a "fixed rank Kriging" approach using
  a large number of basis functions and provides spatial estimates
  that are comparable to standard families of covariance functions.
  Using a large number of basis functions allows for estimates that
  can come close to interpolating the observations (a spatial model
  with a small nugget variance.)  The covariance model for this method
  can approximate the Matern covariance family but also allows for a
  multi-resolution model and supports efficient computation of the
  profile likelihood for estimating covariance parameters. This is
  accomplished through compactly supported basis functions and a
  Markov random field model for the basis coefficients. These features
  lead to sparse matrices for the computations. One benefit of this
  approach is the facilty to do unconditional and conditional
  simulation of the field for large numbers of arbitrary points. There
  is also the flexibility for estimating nonstationary covariances. Included are
  generic methods for prediction, standard errors for prediction,
  plotting of the estimated surface and conditional and unconditional
  simulation.
